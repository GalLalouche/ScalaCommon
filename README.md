# ScalaCommon
Utility Scala functionality and extensions, used in my various projects. A brief summary of the major packages follows.
* **guice** Extensions to [scala-guice](https://github.com/codingwell/scala-guice)
* **os** (Hopefully) OS agnostic utilities
* **rich** Extension methods for collections, primitives, and a lot of added [Scalaz](https://github.com/scalaz/scalaz) functionality
* **storage** Abstract storage as a key-value mapping, along with an implementation for [Slick](https://github.com/slick/slick)
* **test** Extensions for [ScalaTest](https://github.com/scalatest)
* Other odds and ends: mutable and immutable [UnionFind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint-set_data_structure), a memoized Map/Function, LRUCache, etc.
